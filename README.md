### Drunk Mode:

In Drunk Mode, the user's experience is intentionally impaired to simulate the effects of alcohol consumption. The audio becomes slurred and distorted, making it challenging to understand conversations or media content. Text on the screen appears blurry and difficult to read, further adding to the disorienting effect. Navigating through apps and menus becomes a real challenge, as motor skills are simulated to be impaired. This mode aims to raise awareness about the dangers of alcohol-impaired activities and discourage using smartphones while intoxicated.

### Lightspeed Mode:

Lightspeed Mode offers a visually stunning and immersive experience. The wallpaper comes to life with vibrant lights and mesmerizing 3D effects that make it seem like you're traveling through a futuristic cityscape or a cosmic galaxy. However, there's a catch: this mode has limited time usage. Users can enjoy the captivating visuals for a brief period before it automatically reverts to their standard phone settings. It's designed to provide a brief escape from the mundane and transport users into a world of dazzling visuals and creativity.

#
### Hardcore Power Mode:

Hardcore Power Mode is all about pushing the limits of your device's battery life and resilience. In this mode, all power backups and charging options are disabled. Your device operates solely on its remaining battery life, and there's a countdown timer displaying how much time you have left before your device powers off. This mode is for those who thrive on the thrill of using their device with extreme caution and efficiency. It encourages users to manage their time wisely and make the most of their device's battery life, testing their skills in resource management and adaptability.
